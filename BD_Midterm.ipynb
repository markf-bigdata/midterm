    "In this midterm project, we are going to be looking at the average ratings of phones available on Amazon. I chose to do this dataset because I am curious as to which phones have got the worst/best ratings, as well as which phone companies get the most reviews and least reviews. In this lab, we are going to be answering questions such as:\n",
    "- What is the highest rated phone?\n",
    "- What is the lowest rated phone?\n",
    "- What is the average phone rating?\n",
    "- What companies get the highest average ratings on their phones?\n",
    "- What companies get the most reviews on their phones? \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout my analysis of this data, I am going to be making graphs of the average rating and brand, or average amount of reviews on products and brand. These graphs should be able to answer the last two questions I am asking. In this project, I am also going to be removing all products with 5 or less reviews to get rid of some data that would be false due to only 1 or 2 people giving the phone a 1 star/5 star rating or something similar to that.

    "After creating a bar graph of brands and their ratings, we can see that Xiaomi has the best overall ratings, with HUAWEI coming in at second best ratings. We can also see that the lowest rated phone brand is OnePlus, but they have a much larger ___ (line). We were also able to find that the lowest reviewed phone was the ___ and that was by the brand ___ . The highest reviewed phone was the ___ which is made by ___ . This graph allows us to see something quite surprising, which is that apple has a surprisingly low average rating. "

    "This bar plot allows us to see the number of reviews each brand has got. This graph combined with the other graph we made allows us to see even more surprising things, such as that Xiaomi has a decently high number of reviews yet still has a high average rating, compared to a company like apple or google, both of which have a significantly high amount of total reviews and the average rating is around a 3.5-3.75 for both of them, which is the (overall total rating?)"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Throughout the analysis and modeling of this dataset, we learned a surprising amount of information. We learned that the average rating is a 3.66 stars, which is in the range of what I was expecting the average rating to be. I also learned that the product with the lowest average review that had 6 or more reviews was 2.0 stars, and the product with this low review score was the Samsung Gusto and the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, both of which are made by Samsung. I also learned that the highest average review was 5.0 stars on the Samsung Galaxy S9+ by Samsung. Something I noticed about all of these low/high star products was that they had very few reviews on them. The graphs showed us some surprising information, which is that Xiaomi had the most highly reviewed products while also having a somewhat large amount of reviewers on their products. This is a surprising piece of information because I would assume that most companies with a large amount of total reviews would have the average number of reviews for their products be around the same average as all products. I was also surprised by how little reviews ASUS had, but was not surprised by the very high average rating level. If I had to take a guess on something like that, I would assume the less total reviews a brand receives, the average star level for that brand is likely very low/high, and most likely wouldnt be the average."
